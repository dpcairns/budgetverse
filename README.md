# the-money-team
At a minimum, your README.md should include the following:

## The name of the project
The Money Team (TMT)

## Names of the team members
Cherno
Moises
Edmond
Shelby

## A description of the project

## The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems

## Semantic versioning, beginning with version 1.0.0 and incremented as changes are made

## A list of any libraries, frameworks, or packages that your application requires in order to properly function. If needed, provide instructions that the user may need to follow in order to get your application up and running on their own computer.
--JavaScript
--CSS
<!-- --AnimateCSS -->
--HTML
--Chart.js

## Within your code, document with meaningful comments. For example, a comment might provide an overview of what the function beneath it is doing, or describe the relationship between two variables.

Why:

Commented code makes it easier for teammates to understand code that they did not write. It also makes the code base easier for a new person to read through and understand the purpose of each section of code.

Comments should be updated as necessary. Remove all unused, commented-out code before committing to GitHub.

## Daily goals

Day 1: Pitch the idea to your instructor. Once the idea is approved, create your repository, fill your project board with issues, and begin scaffolding your files. Deploy your site, then begin to build features.

Day 2: This should be a big build-out day of features.

Day 3: Continue to build out features. Strive for full MVP by the end of the day.

Day 4: Work on any additional styling and refactoring. Work on some stretch goals. Practice your presentation.

Day 5: Presentation Day!
